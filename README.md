# claude-status-line

A small Rust status-line formatter for Claude Code.

It reads Claude Code status JSON from stdin and prints compact ANSI-colored
segments for:

- model and effort level
- worktree branch
- context window usage
- 5-hour and 7-day rate limit usage

Percentage segments are rounded up and colored by usage:

- green: up to 50%
- yellow: up to 80%
- red: above 80%

## Usage

Build and install the binary somewhere on your `PATH`:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Then configure Claude Code to use it as a status line in
`~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "claude-status-line"
  }
}
```

Claude Code passes status JSON on stdin. You can test the formatter locally
with the included fixture:

```bash
claude-status-line < tests/fixtures/schema.json
```

Example output includes ANSI styling and segments like:

![Example status line](docs/status-line.svg)

```text
worktree-my-feature  ctx 32%  5h 81%  7d 65%  Opus|high
```

## Development

```bash
cargo test
cargo run --quiet < tests/fixtures/schema.json
```
